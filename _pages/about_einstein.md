I'm a 4th-year PhD student at UC Berkeley's EECS department and [BAIR](https://bair.berkeley.edu/index.html#header), working on natural language processing (NLP), clinical decision making and model interpretability. I'm generally interested in language model applications and building trust and safety in large language models (LLMs) for increased model explainability in high-stakes domains. I am fortunate to have been awarded UC Berkeley Chancellor Fellowship and EECS Excellence Award and advised by [Bin Yu](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~yugroup/).

I received my double Bachelor's degrees in electrical engineering and economics from [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/) (NTU).
During my time at NTU, I had the pleasure to have worked with [Lin-Shan Lee](http://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/previous_version/lslNew.htm), [Hung-Yi Lee](http://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~tlkagk/index.html), and [Yu-Chiang Frank Wang](http://vllab.ee.ntu.edu.tw/members.html) on research focusing on dialogue response generation (NLP) and computer vision.

You can find my [resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/185IXhfpj5qxMABRTpfExsSP6zJcjoV2u/view?usp=sharing) here, which includes a non-exhaustive list of people from many institutions (UCSF, UT Austin, Microsoft Research) who took a leap of faith to support, teach, and guide me in research.

When I am not coding, I enjoy reading, being an [amateur film photographer](https://www.instagram.com/ah_amateurfilms/), and mentoring younger students in STEM.
