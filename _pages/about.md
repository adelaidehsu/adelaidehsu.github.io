Hi there! I am an **Applied Scientist at Salesforce AI**, dedicated to advancing the capabilities of autonomous systems. My current work focuses on **agentic workflow optimizations**, **reasoning model fine-tuning**, and engineering **RL frameworks** to enable continuous learning in agents.

Previously, I was a PhD student at **UC Berkeley’s EECS department and [BAIR](https://bair.berkeley.edu/)**, advised by [Bin Yu](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~yugroup/). My doctoral research spanned NLP, interpretability, and AI-assisted clinical decision-making, with a core focus on building trust and safety for neural networks in high-stakes domains.
